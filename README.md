### Introduction
Project descriptionClose your eyes and imagine yourself in an alternative reality; a fantasy world that enables you to escape from everyday life and embody a character that can slay ogres, raid dungeons and collect untold riches. The allure of this abstraction drives over five million people in the US alone to play Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) each week, the most popular of hundreds of dice 20 role playing games (D20 RPGs) that exist across the world. 
### Zeke'S App 
Now imagine it’s your turn and you must calculate the total of several rolls, each di holding a separate numerical attachment defined by that particular game. This distraction not only takes away from the reverie, it also creates room for user miscalculation and opens the door for cheating. 

ZekeS, our dice rolling application, provides a solution to this dilemma! Players are able to join a game, customize up to 20 di, observe the totals of each turn for all players and view exactly how each total is defined. In addition, the totals are auto calculated within the application, saving players valuable time and minimal distraction from their fictional universe. Created by a D&D enthusiast for personal benefit, ZekeS can also be utilized for other D20 RPGs, including Star Wars saga edition, pathfinder, starfinder and many more
